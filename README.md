Followed article here: https://github.com/lyoon-tcs/learning-nextjs-persistent-layouts.git.

Created own repository with identical code to code along and experiment.

1. To check if `SiteLayout` persists (no re-renders), type in the search bar, then navigate to other pages
2. To check if `AccountSettingsLayout` persists (no re-renders), go to account settings, then click on Security tab (farthest right). If it re-renders, should jump back to Basic Information. If not, no movement.
